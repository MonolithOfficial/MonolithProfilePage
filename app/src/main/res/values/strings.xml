    <string name="monolith_desc">Monolith is a musical project started by Cotne Aburjania in December of 2013. The project\'s name comes from a popular video game called S.T.A.L.K.E.R. where Monolith is the name of a highly confidential group that protects a certain shrine, a Monolith, that is located somewhere around Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Project Monolith started out with seemingly soft tracks with heavy ambient hues. Between 2013 and 2017 Monolith was in a state of transition, releasing only 3 tracks, one of which being the Worldline;Dead track that eventually became the title track and main inspiration behind the 2018\'s Worldline;Dead album, Monolith\'s debut record.</string>
